# DeepSeek AI Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered prompt generation platform that leverages DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities to create optimized prompts for various development platforms. The application features a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, real-time WebSocket communication, and a full-stack architecture with user authentication and analytics.

## System Architecture

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates and notifications
- **File Storage**: Multer for file uploads with local storage

### Frontend Architecture
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket client for live data synchronization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Chart.js for analytics visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

### AI Integration
