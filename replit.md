# DeepSeek AI Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered prompt generation platform that leverages DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities to create optimized prompts for various development platforms. The application features a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, real-time WebSocket communication, and a full-stack architecture with user authentication and analytics.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3 for local development, PostgreSQL support via Drizzle ORM for production
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates and notifications
- **File Storage**: Multer for file uploads with local storage

### Frontend Architecture
- **UI Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket client for live data synchronization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Chart.js for analytics visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

### AI Integration
- **Primary AI Service**: DeepSeek API integration with fallback to demo mode
- **RAG System**: Comprehensive document retrieval with semantic search
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Specialized knowledge bases for Replit, Lovable, Cursor, Bolt, and Windsurf

## Key Components

### Services Layer
1. **DeepSeek Service** (`services/deepseekService.js`)
   - AI prompt generation with advanced reasoning
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Usage tracking and metrics

2. **RAG Service** (`services/ragService.js`)
   - Document retrieval and semantic search
   - Multi-platform knowledge integration
   - Caching and performance optimization

3. **WebSocket Service** (`services/websocketService.js`)
   - Real-time communication management
   - Connection pooling and heartbeat monitoring
   - Message broadcasting and channel management

### Data Storage
1. **SQLite Database** (`database.js`)
   - User management and authentication
   - Prompt history and analytics
   - RAG document storage
   - API usage logging

2. **Drizzle ORM Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`)
   - Type-safe database operations
   - Automated migrations
   - Relationship management

### Authentication & Security
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting middleware
- Input sanitization and XSS protection
- SQL injection prevention

## Data Flow

1. **User Request**: Client submits prompt generation request
2. **Authentication**: JWT token validation and user authorization
3. **RAG Retrieval**: Semantic search across platform documentation
4. **AI Processing**: DeepSeek API call with retrieved context
5. **Response Generation**: Structured prompt with reasoning and metadata
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcast of generation progress
7. **Storage**: Persistent storage of generated prompts and analytics
