DEEPSEEK INTEGRATION AND SEAMLESS COMMUNICATION SEE ATTACHED ASSETSDevelop the complete application, integrating all features and functionalities as specified in the blueprint AND ATTACHED ASSETS. Ensure FULL FUNCTIONALITY AND INTEGRATION, providing detailed descriptions without compromising existing functionality. The implementation should be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the application's design, features, and operational logic. The goal is to create a fully functional application that meets all requirements outlined in the blueprint, with a focus on accuracy and detail in the INTERFACE AND LAYOUT.seamlessisgoldenTHERE SHOULD BE SEAMLESS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL AGENTS, MCP HUB, MCP SERVERS AND MCP TOOLS AND RAG 2.0 DATABASE USING A2A AND MCP PROTOCOLS

deepseek-reasoner is a reasoning model developed by DeepSeek. Before delivering the final answer, the model first generates a Chain of Thought (CoT) to enhance the accuracy of its responses. Our API provides users with access to the CoT content generated by deepseek-reasoner, enabling them to view, display, and distill it.

When using deepseek-reasoner, please upgrade the OpenAI SDK first to support the new parameters.

pip3 install -U openai

API Parameters
Input：

max_tokens：The maximum length of the final response after the CoT output is completed, defaulting to 4K, with a maximum of 8K. Note that the CoT output can reach up to 32K tokens, and the parameter to control the CoT length (reasoning_effort) will be available soon.
Output：

reasoning_content：The content of the CoT，which is at the same level as content in the output structure. See API Example for details
contentThe content of the final answer
Context Length：The API supports a maximum context length of 64K, and the length of the output reasoning_content is not counted within the 64K context length.

Supported Features：Chat Completion、Chat Prefix Completion (Beta)

Not Supported Features：Function Call、Json Output、FIM (Beta)

Not Supported Parameters：temperature、top_p、presence_penalty、frequency_penalty、logprobs、top_logprobs. Please note that to ensure compatibility with existing software, setting temperature、top_p、presence_penalty、frequency_penalty will not trigger an error but will also have no effect. Setting logprobs、top_logprobs will trigger an error.

Multi-round Conversation
In each round of the conversation, the model outputs the CoT (reasoning_content) and the final answer (content). In the next round of the conversation, the CoT from previous rounds is not concatenated into the context, as illustrated in the following diagram:


Please note that if the reasoning_content field is included in the sequence of input messages, the API will return a 400 error. Therefore, you should remove the reasoning_content field from the API response before making the API request, as demonstrated in the API example.

API Example
The following code, using Python as an example, demonstrates how to access the CoT and the final answer, as well as how to conduct multi-round conversations:

Streaming
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="<DeepSeek API Key>", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")

# Round 1
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "9.11 and 9.8, which is greater?"}]
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-reasoner",
    messages=messages
)

reasoning_content = response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content
content = response.choices[0].message.content

# Round 2
messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': content})
messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': "How many Rs are there in the word 'strawberry'?"})
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-reasoner",
    messages=messages
)
# ...Multi-round Conversation
This guide will introduce how to use the DeepSeek /chat/completions API for multi-turn conversations.

The DeepSeek /chat/completions API is a "stateless" API, meaning the server does not record the context of the user's requests. Therefore, the user must concatenate all previous conversation history and pass it to the chat API with each request.

The following code in Python demonstrates how to concatenate context to achieve multi-turn conversations.

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="<DeepSeek API Key>", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")

# Round 1
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"}]
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-chat",
    messages=messages
)

messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
print(f"Messages Round 1: {messages}")

# Round 2
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "What is the second?"})
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-chat",
    messages=messages
)

messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
print(f"Messages Round 2: {messages}")

In the first round of the request, the messages passed to the API are:

[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"}
]

In the second round of the request:

Add the model's output from the first round to the end of the messages.
Add the new question to the end of the messages.
The messages ultimately passed to the API are:

[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the second?"}
